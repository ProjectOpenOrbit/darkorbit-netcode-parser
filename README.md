# DarkOrbit Netcode Parser

This library parses decompiled as3 classes from the DarkOrbit flash client
and produces a json file which describes the structure of all packets.

This enables us to easily generate our own netcode classes which are 
compatible with the original Servers.

The library can also be used to generate netcode for private servers.
